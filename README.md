# Devops Guidelines

The Uniphar Group targets the Azure cloud for most of the cloud workloads. The technical stack and tooling is around that of expected for an Azure execution and we do not use any cloud agnostic tools like Terraform because we design infrastructure specifically to maximize performance and cost optimization in Azure.

This document goes through the list of tools, technologies, processes and principles to we use in DevOps within the Uniphar group and should be used as a reference to what is expected to be seen on the internal repositories that contain final DevOps infrastructure as code.
